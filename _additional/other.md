* Developed, launched and operated the [Hebden Rising][HEBDENRISING1]
hyperlocal website in reaction to the floods which affected Hebden Bridge
in June 2012. The site enabled local businesses to communicate with their
customers. It was deployed using Python-based web application frameworks
(webapp2, Jinja2 and WTForms) hosted on Google App Engine, and incorporates
client-side JavaScript integrating the Cloudmade Leaflet mapping library.
