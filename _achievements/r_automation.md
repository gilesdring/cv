Built a library of system and performance log analysis tools using the
__R__ programming language. This improved consistency and saved an average
of 2 hours per analysis run when processing large performance and
infrastructure usage log files. The library enforced a common internal
representation and summarisation of data, ensuring that a wide range of
different format logs could be effectively ingested and correlated when
creating an operational capacity model.
